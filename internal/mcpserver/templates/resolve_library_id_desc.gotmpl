</prerequisites>

<how_to_use>
- Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for.
- Return the most relevant match based on:
  - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
  - Description relevance to the query's intent
  - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
  - Trust score (consider libraries with scores of 7-10 more authoritative)
</how_to_use>

<response_format>
- Return the selected library Resource URI in a clearly marked section
- Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen
- If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
- If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements
